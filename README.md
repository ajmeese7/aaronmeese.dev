# aaronmeese.dev
My [developer playground site](http://aaronmeese.dev), where I play around with unique 
looks to showcase my credentials. As of my writing this, the website is basically a 
placeholder and still has much work that needs to be done.

As I continue my work (whenever I have the time), any feedback, suggestions, improvements, 
or optimizations are welcome. Don't hesitate to create an issue if you think I did something 
poorly or a pull request if you want to fix something or add a cool new feature.

If you want to contact me, feel free to email me at ajmeese7@gmail.com or add me on 
[Discord](https://discord.gg/PxRTQg3) @ajmeese7#4835.
