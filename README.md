This repository, cleverly named by GitHub, contains the source code for [my personal website](http://aaronmeese.com).
As of my writing this, the website is basically a placeholder and still has much work that needs to be done.

As I continue my work (whenever I have the time), any feedback, suggestions, improvements, or optimizations are welcome.
Don't hesitate to create an issue if you think I did something poorly or a pull request if you want to fix something or add a cool new feature.

If you want to contact me, feel free to email me at ajmeese7@gmail.com or add me on [Discord](https://discordapp.com) @ajmeese7#4835.
